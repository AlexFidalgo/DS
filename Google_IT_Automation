USING PYTHON TO INTERACT WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM

cat: command that shows the contents of a file
python3 hello_world.py: executes file
nano hello_world.py: edit file
shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env python3 (we add this line on top of the file (from nano) to tell the OS  what command we want to use to execute that script)

To run our file directly, we want it to be executable; so we need: 
chmod +x hello_world.py 
Now we can run the file by just prefixing it with a dot slash
./hello_world.py
We need the ./ because the script isn't located in any of the directories listed in the path variable. This variable tells the OS where to find executables. The dot 
represents the current directory (find the script in the current directory and execute it)
