USING PYTHON TO INTERACT WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM

cat: command that shows the contents of a file
python3 hello_world.py: executes file
nano hello_world.py: edit file
shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env python3 (we add this line on top of the file (from nano) to tell the OS  what command we want to use to execute that script)
#!/usr/bin/env python3 uses the operating system env command, which locates and executes Python by searching the PATH environment variable. Unlike Windows, the Python 
interpreter is usually already in the $PATH variable on linux, so you don't have to add it.

To run our file directly, we want it to be executable; so we need: 
chmod +x hello_world.py 
Now we can run the file by just prefixing it with a dot slash
./hello_world.py
We need the ./ because the script isn't located in any of the directories listed in the path variable. This variable tells the OS where to find executables. The dot 
represents the current directory (find the script in the current directory and execute it)

vim, atom: linux text editors that have syntax highlighting

The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, it provides functions that support file copying and removal.
isk_usage() method is used to get disk usage statistics of the given path. This method returns a named tuple with the attributes total, used, and free. The total attribute 
represents the total amount of space, the used attribute represents the amount of used space, and the free attribute represents the amount of available space, in bytes.
psutil (Python system and process utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on the processes currently running and system utilization (CPU, memory, 
disks, network, sensors) in Python.
psutil.cpu_percent() returns a float showing the current system-wide CPU use as a percentage.

Requests is a Python module that you can use to send all kinds of HTTP requests. Features range from passing parameters in URLs to sending custom headers and SSL verification.
A request is when you ping a website for information.
You can add headers, form data, multi-part files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries.You can then access the response data using the same request.

Use nano editor to create a new file network.py: nano network.py
check_localhost checks whether the local host is correctly configured. We do this by calling the gethostbyname within the function.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import socket
def check_localhost():
        localhost = socket.gethostbyname('localhost')
        if localhost == '127.0.0.1':
                return True
        return False
def check_connectivity():
        request = requests.get("http://www.google.com") #This returns the website's status code.
        if request.status_code() == 200:
                return True
        retrurn False

(Estou em um nano de outro python file) To import network module at the beginning of the file: from network import *

file = open("spider.txt")
print(file.readline()) #reads a single line of the file
print(file.read()) #reads the entire file
file.close()

with open("spider.txt") as file: #file is automatically closed after the with
        print(file.readline())
        
with open("spider.txt") as file:
        for line in file:
                print(line.upper())

with open("spider.txt") as file:
        for line in file:
                print(line.strip().upper())
                
file = open("spider.txt")
lines = file.readlines()
file.close()
lines.sort()
print(lines)

with open("novel.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("It was a dark and stormy night")
        
If you open a file for writing and the file already exists, the old contents will be deleted as soon as the file is opened.

import os 
os.remove("novel.txt") #deletes file
os.rename("first_draft.txt", "finished_masterpiece.txt")
os.path("finished_masterpiece.txt") #returns whether the file exists or not
os.path.getsize("spider.txt")
os.path.getmtime("spider.txt") #returns when file was last modified (seconds since 1970)
import datetime
timestamp = os.path.getmtime("spider.txt")
datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)
os.path.abspath("spider.txt") #returns the absolut path
