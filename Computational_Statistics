M <- 1:10 #M is an atomic vector of integers
attr(M, "dim") <- c(2,5) # M is now a 2x5 matrix
attr(M, "dim") <- NULL # remove the dimension attribute, M is back to a vector

A <- 1:12
attr(A, "dim") <- c(2,3,2) # more than 2 dimensions

A data frame in R is internally stored as a list of equal length vectors with a class attribute called data.frame (each column must have the same data types)
A factor is a vector used to represent categorical values. It is internally stored as an integer vector with levels and class attributes
gender <- c("M", "F", "F", "X", "M", "F")
gender_fac <- factor(gender)

NA is used to represent missing or unknown values; there are NA for each type
NULL is used to represent an empty or nonexistent value; NULL is its own data type
NaN is type double and is used to represent indeterminate forms in mathematics (such as 0/0 or -Inf + Inf)
